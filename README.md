Project Type:
This is a Playwright-based end-to-end (E2E) testing framework setup. It's not a standalone application, but rather a tool for automating browser tests.

Tech Stack:
- Playwright: E2E testing framework
- TypeScript (potentially, based on playwright.config.ts)
- JavaScript (based on playwright.config.js)
- Node.js (runtime environment)

Architecture:
The architecture is that of a testing framework. It uses Playwright's API to interact with browsers and assert expected behaviors. There isn't a traditional application architecture like MVC or microservices. The core is a test runner that orchestrates browser interactions and assertions.

Key Features:
- E2E test automation
- Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Test configuration management (playwright.config.ts/js)
- Test reporting (HTML reporter)
- Screenshot and video recording on failure
- Trace collection for debugging
- Parallel test execution

Implementation Steps:

1. Target Application: Choose a simple, existing web application (e.g., a basic to-do list app, a static website, or a demo application). If no application is provided, create a simple HTML page with a form and a button.

2. Project Setup:
   - Initialize a Node.js project: `npm init -y`
   - Install Playwright: `npm install -D @playwright/test`
   - Initialize Playwright config: `npx playwright init`

3. Test Case 1: Basic Navigation and Assertion
   - Create a test file (e.g., `tests/basic.spec.ts` or `tests/basic.spec.js`).
   - Write a test that navigates to the target application's homepage.
   - Assert that a specific element (e.g., a heading, a button) is visible on the page.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

     test('homepage has title', async ({ page }) => {
       await page.goto('YOUR_APPLICATION_URL');
       await expect(page.locator('h1')).toContainText('Welcome');
     });
     ```
     Replace `YOUR_APPLICATION_URL` with the actual URL and adjust the locator and expected text accordingly.

4. Test Case 2: Form Interaction
   - Write a test that fills out a form on the target application.
   - Submit the form.
   - Assert that the form submission was successful (e.g., a success message is displayed, a new item is added to a list).
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

     test('can submit form', async ({ page }) => {
       await page.goto('YOUR_APPLICATION_URL/form');
       await page.fill('#name', 'John Doe');
       await page.fill('#email', 'john.doe@example.com');
       await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
       await expect(page.locator('#success-message')).toBeVisible();
     });
     ```
     Replace `YOUR_APPLICATION_URL/form` with the actual form URL and adjust the locators accordingly.

5. Configuration:
   - Configure `playwright.config.ts` or `playwright.config.js` to specify the browsers to test against (e.g., Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
   - Set a base URL if applicable.
   - Enable screenshots on failure: `screenshot: 'only-on-failure'`

6. Execution:
   - Run the tests: `npx playwright test`

7. Reporting:
   - Review the HTML report generated by Playwright to see the test results.

8. Enhancement (Optional):
   - Add more test cases to cover different aspects of the application.
   - Implement data-driven testing using Playwright's `test.describe` and `test.forEach`.
   - Integrate with a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing.

Directive: Ensure the generated tests are robust by using explicit waits and avoiding brittle selectors. Use `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`, and `getByAltText` where appropriate.

Directive: Implement a simple page object model (POM) for the form interaction test to improve maintainability. Create a `FormPage` class with methods for filling out and submitting the form.

Directive: Add a test that uses mocking to simulate a successful API response when submitting the form. This will isolate the front-end test from the back-end.
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('mocks a successful API response', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.route('**/api/submit', async (route) => {
    await route.fulfill({
      status: 200,
      contentType: 'application/json',
      body: JSON.stringify({ success: true, message: 'Form submitted successfully' }),
    });
  });

  await page.goto('YOUR_APPLICATION_URL/form');
  await page.fill('#name', 'John Doe');
  await page.fill('#email', 'john.doe@example.com');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  await expect(page.locator('#success-message')).toContainText('Form submitted successfully');
});
```
Replace `YOUR_APPLICATION_URL/form` with the actual form URL..................................
